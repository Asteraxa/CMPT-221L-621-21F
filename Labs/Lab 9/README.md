We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

When it comes to deploying my group's website, I would likely use a combination of AWS for hosting our server, due to its balance between cost and functionality, and Apache for communicating between the client and server, due to its flexibility and ability to handle dynamic content compared to NGINX. Additionally, as a more advanced form of Docker, we would make use of Kubernetes' containerization and load balance services in order to help manage the site's workload and prevent excessive monetary costs on our end. Finally, we will definitely take the time to acquire a web certificate, in order to guarentee people's trust in our service.
